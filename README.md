- `GET /v1/ships/by-owner/:owner_id` - Get all ships for owner

### State Management

- **Zustand**: Auth state (tokens, profile info)
- **React Query**: API data caching and synchronization
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent token storage

### Data Models

**Character Attributes (20 points total):**
- Piloting (1-10): Ship maneuverability
- Engineering (1-10): Tech/repair bonuses
- Science (1-10): Research and discovery
- Tactics (1-10): Combat effectiveness
- Leadership (1-10): Crew bonuses

**Ship Stats (30 points total):**
- Hull Strength (1-15): Durability × 100 HP
- Shield Capacity (1-15): Shields × 50
- Speed (1-15): Travel speed
- Cargo Space (1-15): Capacity × 10 units
- Sensors (1-15): Detection range

**Ship Type Bonuses:**
- Scout: +2 Speed, +2 Sensors
- Fighter: +300 Hull HP, +100 Shield
- Trader: +100 Hull HP, +40 Cargo
- Explorer: +1 Speed, +10 Cargo, +2 Sensors

## User Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account with email and password
2. **Create Character**: Allocate 20 points across 5 attributes
3. **Customize Ship**: Choose ship type and allocate 30 stat points
4. **Dashboard**: View all your characters and ships

### Character Creation

1. Enter a unique character name (3-32 characters)
2. Allocate 20 points across five attributes
3. Use +/- buttons to adjust each attribute (min 1, max 10)
4. Ensure all 20 points are allocated (remaining shows 0/20)
5. Click "Create Character" to proceed to ship customization

### Ship Customization

1. Select ship type to see bonuses
2. Optionally enter a ship name
3. Allocate 30 points across five stats
4. Use +/- buttons (min 1, max 15 per stat)
5. Preview ship in 3D viewer (auto-rotates, zoom with mouse wheel)
6. Check "Final Stats" panel to see calculated values with bonuses
7. Click "Launch Ship" to complete
